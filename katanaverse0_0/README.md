### Challenge Description

Subject Zero, 

Guess what? We found a secret vault, and it supposedly spills the beans on Chronos. We know you're itching for the truth, so we're handing this over to you.

To crack the vault, think weird. Twist logic, mess with time â€“ you got it. The code is the key, and it's like a puzzle in a wonky dimension.
